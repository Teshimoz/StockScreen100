<b>Notebook to get the current prices of assets in portfolio, visualise it's distribution and trendlines<b>
<br>
<br>
In this project we will observe one porfolio, it's assets current values and changes during last year. It's passive invested portfolio.<br>
Will make a calculations for rebalancing and also will visualise current state vs target proportion, last year prices vs target proportion.<br>
Also will make some extrapolations, keeping in mind all the limitations of this approach in stock market predictions.<br>
